      "question": "Explain why water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level.",
      "solution": "Water boiling at 100 degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) at sea level is a fundamental concept in physics and chemistry. To understand why this occurs, let's dive into the underlying principles.\n\n**What is boiling?**\n\nBoiling is the process by which a liquid transforms into a gas. In the case of water, boiling occurs when the molecules gain enough energy to break free from the surface tension of the liquid and turn into water vapor.\n\n**Factors influencing boiling point**\n\nThe boiling point of a liquid is influenced by two main factors:\n\n1. **Intermolecular forces**: The strength of the attractive forces between molecules in a liquid. In water, these forces are primarily hydrogen bonds, which are relatively strong.\n2. **External pressure**: The pressure exerted on the liquid by its surroundings. At sea level, the atmospheric pressure is approximately 1013 millibars (mbar) or 1 atmosphere (atm).\n\n**Why 100\u00b0C at sea level?**\n\nAt sea level, the atmospheric pressure is sufficient to prevent water molecules from escaping the surface of the liquid until they have reached a certain energy level. This energy level corresponds to a temperature of 100\u00b0C.\n\nHere's what happens at the molecular level:\n\n* As water is heated, the molecules gain kinetic energy and start moving faster.\n* At 100\u00b0C, the molecules have enough energy to overcome the intermolecular forces (hydrogen bonds) holding them together.\n* The molecules at the surface of the liquid are able to break free from the surface tension and turn into water vapor.\n* The surrounding atmospheric pressure (1 atm) is sufficient to prevent the water vapor from expanding rapidly, allowing the boiling process to occur at a relatively constant temperature.\n\n**The role of atmospheric pressure**\n\nThe atmospheric pressure at sea level plays a crucial role in determining the boiling point of water. If the pressure were lower, the boiling point would be lower as well, because the molecules would require less energy to escape the surface tension. Conversely, if the pressure were higher, the boiling point would be higher, as the molecules would need more energy to overcome the increased pressure.\n\n**Variation with altitude**\n\nAs you go higher in altitude, the atmospheric pressure decreases. This decrease in pressure reduces the boiling point of water, because the molecules require less energy to escape the surface tension. For example, at an altitude of 2,000 meters (6,562 feet), the boiling point of water is approximately 93\u00b0C.\n\nIn summary, water boils at 100\u00b0C at sea level because of the balance between the intermolecular forces holding the molecules together and the external pressure exerted by the atmosphere. The specific temperature of 100\u00b0C is a result of the combination of these factors, which allows the water molecules to break free from the surface tension and turn into water vapor at a relatively constant temperature.",

      "question": "Explain why water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level.",
      "solution": "Water boiling at 100 degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) at sea level is a fundamental concept in physics and chemistry. To understand why this occurs, let's dive into the underlying principles.\n\n**What is boiling point?**\n\nThe boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the surrounding atmospheric pressure. At this temperature, the molecules of the liquid have enough energy to break free from the surface tension and turn into vapor.\n\n**Factors affecting boiling point**\n\nThe boiling point of a liquid is influenced by two main factors:\n\n1. **Atmospheric pressure**: The pressure exerted by the surrounding air, which is typically measured in units of pascals (Pa) or millibars (mbar).\n2. **Intermolecular forces**: The attractive and repulsive forces between the molecules of the liquid, which determine the energy required for the molecules to escape the liquid's surface.\n\n**Why water boils at 100\u00b0C at sea level**\n\nAt sea level, the atmospheric pressure is approximately 1013 mbar (or 101,325 Pa). This pressure is the result of the weight of the air molecules in the atmosphere above the Earth's surface.\n\nWater molecules are polar, meaning they have a slightly positive charge on one end (hydrogen atoms) and a slightly negative charge on the other end (oxygen atom). This polarity creates intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonding, between water molecules. These forces hold the molecules together and require energy to overcome.\n\nWhen water is heated, the molecules gain kinetic energy and start moving faster. As the temperature increases, the molecules' energy increases, and they begin to break free from the intermolecular forces. At 100\u00b0C, the energy of the water molecules is sufficient to overcome the intermolecular forces and the atmospheric pressure, allowing them to escape the liquid's surface and turn into vapor.\n\n**The balance between vapor pressure and atmospheric pressure**\n\nAt 100\u00b0C, the vapor pressure of water equals the atmospheric pressure at sea level. This means that the energy required for the water molecules to escape the liquid's surface is equal to the energy exerted by the surrounding air molecules. As a result, the water molecules can freely transition between the liquid and gas phases, which is the definition of boiling.\n\n**Mathematical representation**\n\nThe boiling point of a liquid can be described by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a liquid to its temperature:\n\nln(P2/P1) = (\u0394H/R) \\* (1/T1 - 1/T2)\n\nwhere:\nP1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively\n\u0394H is the enthalpy of vaporization (the energy required to vaporize a mole of liquid)\nR is the gas constant\n\nUsing this equation, we can calculate the boiling point of water at sea level, which is approximately 100\u00b0C.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, water boils at 100\u00b0C at sea level because the energy of the water molecules at this temperature is sufficient to overcome the intermolecular forces and the atmospheric pressure, allowing them to escape the liquid's surface and turn into vapor.
